Building a Cricket Batting Strike Rate Calculator.

A cricket batting strike rate is a statistic that measures how quickly a batter scores runs. It is calculated as the number of runs scored per 100 balls faced.

A higher strike rate indicates faster scoring, which is especially important in limited-overs cricket formats like T20s and One-Day Internationals(ODIs).
